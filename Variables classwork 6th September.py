print(" x ", "\nxxx", "\n x ")

zero = 0
print(type(zero))

# when naming variables, we want to ensure readibility so we either use camelcase firstName, or first_name

#print = "page" won't work because it's a reserved word

Print = "page"
print(Print)

# Rules:
# When naming a variable, only special character allowed is an underscore
# Integers cannot be at the start of the variable
# No spaces in a variable
# No numbers on their own
# No reserved words

# Best Practice
# Use camelcase or underscore
