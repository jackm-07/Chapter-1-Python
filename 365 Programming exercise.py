# I defined the three repeating patterns as variables
ThreeFive = "##### ##### #####"
ThreeTwo = "   ## ##    ##   "
FourTwo = "   ## ## ##    ##"
# I then printed the different patterns and after a little tweaking I got my intended result
print(ThreeFive)
print(ThreeTwo)
print(ThreeFive)
print(FourTwo)

#Python Reflection:
#Python likes defining strings, lowercase letters, brackets
#Pyton dislikes indentation, and not using brackets or quotations
